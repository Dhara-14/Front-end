            <p>Erode is a city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.It is located on the banks of the Kaveri river and is surrounded by the Western Ghats.   Erode is the seventh largest urban agglomeration in Tamil Nadu. It is the administrative capital of Erode district and is administered by the Erode Municipal Corporation which was established in 2008.
                The region was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE. The medieval Cholas conquered the region in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system. In the later part of the 18th century, the it came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed it to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region played a prominent role in the second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.Post Indian Independence in 1947, Erode was part of Coimbatore district. It was established as the capital of the newly formed Erode district in 1979. Erode is a part of Erode Lok Sabha constituency that elects its member of parliament. Erode is a major agricultural, industrial and educational hub. Erode is among the largest producers of turmeric and Erode Turmeric is recognized as Geographical Indications by the Government of India. The textile boom in the early 20th century and rapid growth due to industrialization has seen Erode becoming a major producer of handloom and knitwear.Etymology
                There are two theories regarding the origin of the name Erode. It might have its origin in the Tamil phrase Eeru Odai meaning two streams based on the water courses Perumpallam and Pichaikaranpallam canals.[3] Alternatively, it might have been derived from the Tamil phrase Eera Odu meaning 'wet skull', based on the temple of Shiva in the city and the mythology associated with it.[4][5][6]
                
                History
                During Sangam period, the region formed a part of the Kongu Nadu region ruled by Cheras and then by Kalabhras. The region came under the Pandyas around 590 CE. Afterward, it was ruled by Rashtrakutas and by Cholas from the 10th to early 13th century. Erode was annexed by Vijayanagara Empire in 1378 CE till 1559 CE. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an independent kingdom introducing the Palayakkarar system.[7] Erode became a part of the Hindu Wodeyar-ruled Mysore Kingdom in the early 1700s CE before coming under the control of the British East India Company with Maharaja of Mysore still as a nominal ruler. Erode remained under British Colonial rule until the Indian independence in 1947.[8][9][10]
                
                Climate
                Erode has a semi-arid climate with hot to sweltering temperatures throughout the year and relatively low rainfall. Temperatures range from 80 °F (27 °C) to 96 °F (36 °C) with an average rainfall of 543 millimetres or 21.4 inches. Like the rest of Tamil Nadu, March to June are the hottest and December to January the mildest months of the year. Because the Southwest monsoon (June to August) brings scanty rainfall, the bulk of Erode's rainfall is received during the Northeast monsoon in October and November. The city covers an area of 8.44 km2 (8,440,000 m2).[11]
