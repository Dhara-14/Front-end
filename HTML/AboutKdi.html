        Kodiveri Dam is a masonry dam located on the Bhavani river in Gobichettipalayam taluk, Erode district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The dam is situated along the State Highway 15 about 15 km (9.3 mi) from Gobichettipalayam towards Sathyamangalam in the western region of the state.

            <dt>Etymology</dt>
            <dd>The name ‘Kodiveri’ originated from ‘kodivari’ meaning tiger in Tamil. This might be due to the presence of the dam in a forest area where a number of tigers lived.[1]

                urali semba vettuva jeyangonda chola Kongalvan Vettuva Gounder King built the dam in the year 1125 AD. A 20-foot rock wall was carved out in order to build the dam. Iron bars were then used to interlock the stones, and lead was used as mortar. The small waterfall created by the flowing river water from the other side of the dam is purely a delight to the eyes.
                
                Due to non-availability of rocks in Kodiveri, rocks were quarried from Kalkadampur (Kambatrayan Hill), 10 km north of Sathyamangalam. Skilled masons from Odisha, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were brought in for the construction work.[5]</dd>

    <p>The dam was completed in about 3 years.  On the day of opening the dam, it was arranged that the king would come.  But, a sudden flood broke out and the dam was completely washed away.  The information went to the king.  He again ordered the dam to be built.  Accordingly, the dam was built again in about one and a half years.  When the king was about to open the dam again, there was another flood.  Thousands of people died this time.[5]</p>
    <p>The king, who was very saddened, said, “Pannari Amman and Nanjundeshwar are preventing me from going there.  I and my family will not come there from now on, he says.  Also, the one who ordered the construction of the dam again tells him to ensure that the information does not reach him after the construction of the dam is completed.  Accordingly, the dam was completed for the third time.  That is the flag root dam which is still standing today.  Accordingly, a dam was constructed with a length of 151 meters and a width of 30 feet.[5]</p>

            <dd>The dam is built on the Bhavani river. Two channels arise from the dam, Arrakkankottai on the northern side of Bhavani river and Thadapalli on the southern side.[2][3] Lands north of Gobichettipalayam are irrigated by Thadapalli channel and cultivation of sugarcane and paddy are predominant in this area. The dam irrigates an area of 24,504 acres (9,916 ha).[4][5]</dd>
